A demo written by [Georgiy Tugai](https://github.com/Georgiy-Tugai) that uses the [Clang ASTMatcher](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/LibASTMatchersReference.html) facility within [Clasp](https://github.com/drmeister/clasp) to parse and analyze C++ code.

Before running this on your own machine, make sure to run `update.sh` or manually update the `directory` key in `compile_commands.json` to the absolute path to the directory containing this file.
